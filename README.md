# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm, allowing players to play against an AI opponent.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the Minimax algorithm in action by creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can compete against an AI opponent. The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.

## Features

- Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay.
- AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.
- Ability to play against the computer or against another player.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the following command to start the game:

    ```
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In the context of this Tic-Tac-Toe game, the AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move by considering all possible future game states.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell of a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
